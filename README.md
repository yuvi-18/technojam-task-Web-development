Hey, I am Yuvraj Singh, I am from bareilly Uttar Pradesh, studying BCA AI ML from galgotias University. So, This repo contains a web dev project of text translator, since I have done some web dev projects earlier so this wasn't that hard but it was a new thing for me I didn't knew that we can use js to get text to speech which was an intresting and new thing that i learnt from this project, basicaly I just took some design inspirations from other text to speech translation sites and built something similar but yet unique and tried to be as original as possible. the difficult part was at the api integration, cause I wasn't getting the api key and it wasn't working so first I tried to implement that api but then I decided to swtich to other api and fetched that api which was working as good as the previous one and worked in just one line of code whereas the previous one would take a whole function and complex code to run, so i modified the code into a simplier and easily understandable code, did all this in very limited time as i was constantly busy in some personal work basically had to visit the doctor daily, so tried to do something with the limited time I had.
